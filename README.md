# Scala Continuations meet JVM Coroutines

Source code from the [talk](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/scala-continuations) I gave at Skills Matter during Scala LiftOff London, 2011.

Compile the Scala sources with -P:continuations:enable. Any Scala or Java code which refers to the java.dyn package (ie. all the uses of Coroutine or AsymCoroutine) should be compiled and run relative to the JVM coroutine-enabled JDK available [here](http://ssw.jku.at/General/Staff/LS/coro/).
